# Pokédex Central

Pokédex Central is a project for practicing React Router.

This web app fetches Pokémon data from an external API, listing them on the main page with individual detail pages for each Pokémon.

It also includes an About page and a Landing page for a complete user experience.

Built with React Router and Vite, this app allows smooth navigation between pages.

Best repo ever!
