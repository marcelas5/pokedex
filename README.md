Pokédex Central is a project designed to practice React Router.
This web application fetches Pokémon data from an external API, listing them on the main page with individual detail pages for each Pokémon.
It also includes an About page and a Landing page for a complete user experience.
Built with React Router and Vite, the app allows smooth navigation between pages.
